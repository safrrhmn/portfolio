                Let me introduce you with the Top Navigation of this blog. I worked hard to separate the ideas and technologies I talked
                about here. This is a blog where I try to jot down my ideas, things I often forget, the collection of latest
                technologies and small things I often use to make my work and personal life easier. This is like an on-going
                responsibilities for me. I try to constantly update this to meet my and your needs. Since, I have a full-time
                job itâ€™s often hard to spare some time to dedicate on this blog. But, I try. And, of course, if you find
                any information provided is incorrect please let me know and this way I can correct myself..
